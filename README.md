      - Initial build is for small screen. Code further adapted for larger screen sizes.
      - At large screen size, multiple navigation bar links laid out horizontally. Using javascript, horizontal navigation
        bar is hidden at smaller screen sizes. In its place is a clickable bars icon revealing a vertical navigation bar.
